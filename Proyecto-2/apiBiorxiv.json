      "rel_abs": "Importance: The U.S. arrival of the Omicron variant led to a rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 infections. While numerous studies report characteristics of Omicron infections among vaccinated individuals and/or persons with a prior history of infection, comprehensive data describing infections among immunologically naive adults is lacking. Objective: To examine COVID-19 acute and post-acute clinical outcomes among a well-characterized cohort of unvaccinated and previously uninfected adults who contracted SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron (BA.1/BA.2) surge, and to compare outcomes with infections that occurred during the Delta wave. Design: A prospective cohort undergoing high-resolution symptom and virologic monitoring between June 2021 and September 2022 Setting: Multisite recruitment of community-dwelling adults in 8 U.S. states Participants: Healthy, unvaccinated adults between 30 to 64 years of age without an immunological history of SARS-CoV-2 who were at high-risk of infection were recruited. Participants were followed for up to 48 weeks, submitting regular COVID-19 symptom surveys and nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Exposure(s): Omicron (BA.1/BA.2 lineages) versus Delta SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as a positive PCR that occurred during a period when the variant represented [&ge;]50% of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the participant's geographic region. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The main outcomes examined were the prevalence and severity of acute ([&le;]28 days post-onset) and post-acute ([&ge;]5 weeks post-onset) symptoms. Results: Among 274 immunologically naive participants, 166 (61%) contracted SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 137 (83%) and 29 (17%) infections occurred during the Omicron- and Delta-predominant periods, respectively. Asymptomatic infections occurred among 6.7% (95% CI: 3.1%, 12.3%) of Omicron cases and 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0%, 11.9%) of Delta cases. Healthcare utilization among Omicron cases was 79% (95% CI: 43%, 92%, P=0.001) lower relative to Delta cases. Relative to Delta, Omicron infections also experienced a 56% (95% CI: 26%, 74%, P=0.004) and 79% (95% CI: 54%, 91%, P<0.001) reduction in the risk and rate of post-acute symptoms, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that among previously immunologically naive adults, few Omicron (BA.1/BA.2) and Delta infections are asymptomatic, and relative to Delta, Omicron infections were less likely to seek healthcare and experience post-acute symptoms.",

      "rel_abs": "Background Prone positioning (PP) is routinely used among patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation. However, its utility among spontaneously breathing patients is still debated. Methods In an open-label randomized controlled trial, we enrolled patients hospitalized with mild COVID-19 pneumonia, whose PaO2/FiO2 ratio was >200 mmHg and who did not require mechanical ventilation (MV) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at hospital admission. Patients were randomized 1:1 to PP on top of standard of care (intervention group) versus standard of care only (controls). The primary composite outcome included death, MV, NIV and PaO2/FiO2 <200 mmHg; secondary outcomes were oxygen weaning and hospital discharge. Results Sixty-one subjects were enrolled, 29 adjudicated to PP and 32 to the control group. By day 28, 11 patients required NIV, 4 MV and 3 died. Overall, 24/61 (39.3%) met the primary outcome. Using an intention-to-treat approach, 15/29 patients in PP group versus 9/32 controls met the primary outcome, corresponding to a significantly higher risk of progression among those randomized to PP (HR 2.38 95%CI 1.04-5.43; P=0.040). Using an as-treated approach, which included in the intervention group only patients who maintained PP for [&ge;]3 hours/day, no significant differences were found between the two groups (HR 1.77; 95%CI 0.79-3.94; P=0.165). Also, we did not find any statistically difference in terms of time to oxygen weaning or hospital discharge between study arms, in any of the analyses conducted. Conclusions We observed no clinical benefit from awake PP among spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring conventional oxygen therapy.",

      "rel_abs": "Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic veterinary diagnostic laboratories have tested diagnostic samples for SARS-CoV-2 not only in animals, but in over five million human samples. An evaluation of the performance of those laboratories is needed using blinded test samples to ensure that laboratories report reliable data to the public. This interlaboratory comparison exercise (ILC3) builds on two prior exercises to assess whether veterinary diagnostic laboratories can detect Delta and Omicron variants spiked in canine nasal matrix or viral transport medium. Methods: Inactivated Delta variant at levels of 25 to 1,000 copies per 50 microliters of nasal matrix were prepared for participants by the ILC organizer, an independent laboratory, for blinded analysis. Omicron variant at 1,000 copies per 50 microliters of transport medium was also included. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) RNA was used as a confounder for specificity assessment. A total of 14 test samples were prepared for each participant. Participants used their routine diagnostic procedures for RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR. Results were analyzed according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 16140 - 2:2016. Results: The overall results showed 93% detection for Delta and 97% for Omicron at 1,000 copies per 50 microliters (22-200 copies per reaction). The overall specificity was 97% for blank samples and 100% for blank samples with FIPV. No differences in Ct values were significant for samples with the same virus levels between N1 and N2 markers, nor between the two variants. Conclusions: The results indicated that all ILC3 participants were able to detect both Delta and Omicron variants. The canine nasal matrix did not significantly affect SARS-CoV-2 detection.",

We formed a study cohort (n = 71 592) mainly consisting of health care workers by restricting to people 18-64 years old who received their first vaccine dose relatively early (24 April 2021 or sooner). We used continuous density case-control 1:10 sampling matched for sex and age within the study cohort, and thereby obtained 1 114 cases during Omicron BA.5 dominance and 11 140 controls who were analysed with conditional logistic regression. Limited protection against reinfection was suggested from prior infection of virus variants before Omicron (11%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -10 to 28%]. By contrast, prior Omicron infection offered clear protection (65%, 95% CI 56-73%). For the Omicron BA.2 subvariant, stronger protection was suggested during early (85%, 95% CI 75-91%) than later BA.5 dominance (66%, 95% CI 48-78%). Lower protection was observed from the previous BA.1 subvariant (30%; 95% CI -4 to 53%). These findings suggest that natural infection from the Omicron subvariants contributes to short-term population protection against reinfection with the subvariant BA.5 among vaccinated, but wanes considerably 5-6 months after infection.",

      "rel_abs": "OBJECTIVES: To describe episodic nature of disability among adults living with Long COVID. METHODS: We conducted a community-engaged qualitative descriptive study involving online semi-structured interviews and participant visual illustrations. We recruited participants via collaborator community organizations in Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and United States. Participants: Adults who self-identified as living with Long COVID. We purposively recruited for diversity in age, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and duration since initial COVID-19 infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES(S): We used a semi-structured interview guide to explore experiences of disability living with Long COVID, specifically health-related challenges and how they were experienced over time. We asked participants to draw their health trajectory and conducted a group-based content analysis. RESULTS: Among the 40 participants, the median age was 39 years (interquartile range: 32, 49); majority were women (63%), white (73%), heterosexual (75%), and living with Long COVID for [&ge;]1 year (83%). Participants described their disability experiences as episodic in nature, characterized by fluctuations in presence and severity of health-related challenges (disability) that may occur both within a day and over the long-term living with Long COVID. They described living with 'ups and downs', 'flare-ups', and 'peaks' followed by 'crashes', 'troughs', and 'valleys', likened to a 'yo-yo', 'rolling hills', and 'rollercoaster ride' with 'relapsing/remitting', 'waxing/waning', 'fluctuations' in health. Drawn illustrations demonstrated variety of trajectories across health dimensions, some more episodic than others. Uncertainty intersected with the episodic nature of disability, characterized as unpredictability of episodes, their length, severity and triggers, and process of long-term trajectory, which had implications on broader health. CONCLUSIONS: Among this sample of adults living with Long COVID, experiences of disability were described as episodic, characterized by fluctuating health challenges, which may be unpredictable in nature. Results help to better understand experiences of disability among adults living with Long COVID to inform healthcare and rehabilitation.",

      "rel_abs": "Rapid classification and detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants have been critical in comprehending the virus's transmission dynamics. Clinical manifestation of the infection is influenced by comorbidities such as age, immune status, diabetes, and the infecting variant. Thus, clinical management may differ for new variants. For example, some monoclonal antibody treatments are variant-specific. Yet, an FDA-approved test for detecting the SARS-CoV-2 variant is unavailable. A laboratory-developed test (LDT) remains a viable option for reporting the infecting variant for clinical intervention or epidemiological purposes. Accordingly, we have validated the Illumina COVID-Seq assay as an LDT according to the guidelines prescribed by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The limit of detection (LOD) of this test is Ct<30 (~15 viral copies) and >200X genomic coverage, and the test is 100% specific in the detection of existing variants. The test demonstrated 100% precision in inter-day, intra-day, and intra-laboratory reproducibility studies. It is also 100% accurate, defined by reference strain testing and split sample testing with other CLIA laboratories. Advanta Genetics LDT COVID Seq has been reviewed by CAP inspectors and is under review by FDA for Emergency Use Authorization.",

The PLUS Assay is similar to the SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV combination test, with the exception of an additional SARS-CoV-2 target that was included to improve assay robustness against emerging variants. The performance characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV PLUS combination test were assessed at the Lakeridge Health Oshawa Hospital Centre and the National Microbiology Laboratory of Canada. The PLUS Assay was directly compared to the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV combination test using SARS-CoV-2 culture from five variants and remnant clinical specimens collected across multiple waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. This included 110 clinical specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, RSVA, and/or RSVB and an additional 11 mixed samples to screen for target interactions. Additionally, 50 samples negative for all pathogens were included in this comparison. The PLUS Assay showed a high percent agreement with the widely used SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV combination test. Based on the findings from this study, the PLUS Assay and the Xpert SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV combination test results are largely consistent as there was no observed difference in sensitivity, specificity, reported Ct value, or time to result when challenged with various SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

      "rel_abs": "Aim: The present study discussed the humoral immune response and antibody dynamics after primary and booster immunity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines among patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) in the real world. Thus, it provided data to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategy. Methods: Patients with confirmed CLD and completed primary or booster immunity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were enrolled. Serological specimens were collected after primary or booster immunity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to detect novel coronavirus neutralizing antibody (nCoV NTAb) and novel coronavirus spike receptor-binding domain antibody (nCoV S-RBD). Thus, we could evaluate the humoral immune response and antibody dynamics after primary and booster immunity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines among patients with CLD. Simultaneously, baseline demographics, liver disease-related situations, comorbidity-related situations, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination information, and laboratory examination-related indicators of patients were collected. Results: A total of 315 patients received SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, including 223 patients who completed the primary immunity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, 114 patients who completed booster immunity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and 22 patients who underwent the antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines after both primary and booster immunities. The positive rate of nCoV NTAb was 59.64% in Primary and 87.72% in Booster (P<0.001). The median level of nCoV NTAb was 11.53 AU/mL in Primary and 31.98 AU/mL in Booster (P<0.001). The positive rate of nCoV S-RBD was 69.06% in Primary and 91.23% in Booster (P<0.001). The median level of nCoV S-RBD was 21.60AU/mL in Primary and 112.65 AU/mL in Booster (P<0.001). After booster immunity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in 22 patients, the positive rate of nCoV NTAb increased from 59.09% to 86.36%, and that of nCoV S-RBD increased from 68.18% to 90.91%. The median level of nCoV NTAb increased from 11.24 AU /mL to 59.14 AU /mL after booster immunity. The median level of nCoV S-RBD increased from 27.28 AU/mL to 219.10 AU/mL. Compared to the antibody level of primary immunity, the median level of nCoV NTAb and nCoV S-RBD in 22 patients was increased by 5.26 and 8.03 times, respectively. Among 22 patients, 9 were negative for nCoV NTAb after primary immunity, while 6 were transformed positive after booster immunity, and the positive conversion rate of nCoV NTAb was 66.7%. On the other hand, 7 patients were negative for nCoV S-RBD after primary immunity, while 5 were transformed positive after booster immunity, and the positive conversion rate of nCoV S-RBD was 71.4%. Conclusion: Patients with CLD show improved humoral immune response after completing primary and booster immunity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, while booster immunity further improves the positive rate and antibody level of patients with CLD. Finally, the positive conversion rate among patients with primary immunity failure also can be improved after booster immunity.

It is therefore necessary to develop strategies to determine the conditions under which cultural activities can be maintained. In this study the results from available literature were combined with findings, guidelines and regulations for other indoor environments and recommendations were derived. In the cultural sector, the number of experimental investigations, surveys and simulations is comparatively small. This is probably due to the complexity of the events in terms of location and visitor flow, so the respective conditions under which they take place can be very different. It is therefore practically impossible to predict the risk of infection for a specific situation with potential virus spreaders attending or to derive general rules that go beyond the known measures of vaccination, testing, masks and distance. Cultural events can be held under pandemic conditions, provided certain conditions are met. Most study results agree on this. However, any recommendations for hygiene, safety and ventilation measures in cultural institutions can only minimize the risk of infection, but cannot completely rule it out. It is also of considerable importance that visitors protect themselves individually and act responsibly.",

Questions also remain about wear and tear including how long filters retain their filtration properties and need to be replaced. Herein we report real-world experience from daily usage of 47 HEPA and 60 DIY air cleaners in a California elementary school during the academic school year from spring 2021 through fall of 2022 across 16 classrooms, a library, an auditorium, a lunchroom, and in a hallway. Three to six purifiers were needed in classrooms to meet California (CDPH) recommended 6 to 12 air changes per hour (ACH) for prevention of aerosol transmission of COVID-19 in classrooms. Teachers reported noise generated by DIY purifiers on lowest fan speed as acceptable for classroom use. Filtration efficiency at 0.3 m (most penetrating particle size) for DIY air cleaners with 5\" MERV 16 filters used in the classrooms averages 77% after six months compared to 92% for newly installed filters. Portable air cleaners (HEPA and DIY) averaged and estimated 10 ACH (6-15 ACH) across the 16 classrooms demonstrating feasibility and unit economics of meeting CDPH targets per classroom for $200-$650 with DIY versus $600-$12,000 with the HEPA models used. In one 9000 cubic foot classroom with 7 air purifiers, air exchange rate was measured using ambient aerosols at 18 ACH from air purifiers (within 20% of ACH estimated based on CADR of purifiers) and 7 ACH from HVAC for a combined total of 25 ACH. The procedure using ambient aerosols to verify ACH from portable air cleaners and HVAC can be the basis for ACH certification or verification without generating aerosol contaminants (e.g. salt water, smoke, tracers) which may be unsafe or disallowed in schools.",

The array contains antigens for respiratory syncytial virus, seasonal influenza, common human coronaviruses, MERS, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2. AIR measures a change in reflectivity due to the binding of serum antibodies to the antigens on the array. Samples were collected from convalescent COVID-19 donors and individuals vaccinated with a two-dose mRNA vaccine regimen. Vaccinated samples were collected prior to the first dose, one week after the first dose, one week after the second dose, and monthly thereafter. Information following booster dose and/or breakthrough infection is included for a subset of subjects. Longitudinal samples of vaccinated individuals demonstrate a rise and fall of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in agreement with general knowledge of the adaptive immune response and other studies. Linear Regression analysis was performed to understand the relationship between antibodies binding to different antigens on the array. Our analysis identified strong correlations between closely related influenza virus strains as well as correlations between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and human coronavirus 229E. A small test of using diluted whole blood from a fingerstick provided clean arrays with antibody binding comparable to serum. Potential applications include assessing immunity in the context of exposure to multiple respiratory viruses, clinical serology, population monitoring to facilitate public health recommendations, and vaccine development against new viruses and virus mutations.",

      "rel_abs": "The COVID-19 pandemy has created a radically new situation where most countries provide raw measurements of their daily incidence and disclose them in real time. This enables new machine learning forecast strategies where the prediction might no longer be based just on the past values of the current incidence curve, but could take advantage of observations in many countries. We present such a simple global machine learning procedure using all past daily incidence trend curves. Each of the 27,418 COVID-19 incidence trend curves in our database contains the values of 56 consecutive days extracted from observed incidence curves across 61 word regions and countries. Given a current incidence trend curve observed over the past four weeks, its forecast in the next four weeks is computed by matching it with the first four weeks of all samples, and ranking them by their similarity to the query curve. Then the 28 days forecast is obtained by a statistical estimation combining the values of the 28 last observed days in those similar samples. Using comparison performed by the European Covid-19 Forecast Hub with the current state of the art forecast methods, we verify that the proposed global learning method, EpiLearn, compares favorably to methods forecasting from a single past curve.",

      "rel_abs": "Altered myeloid inflammation and lymphopenia are hallmarks of severe infections, including with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we identified a gene program, defined by correlation with EN-RAGE (S100A12) gene expression, which was up-regulated in airway and blood myeloid cells from COVID-19 patients. The EN-RAGE program was expressed in 7 cohorts and observed in patients with both COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from other causes. This program was associated with greater clinical severity and predicted future mechanical ventilation and death. EN-RAGE+ myeloid cells express features consistent with suppressor cell functionality, with low HLA-DR and high PD-L1 surface expression and higher expression of T cell-suppressive genes. Sustained EN-RAGE signature expression in airway and blood myeloid cells correlated with clinical severity and increasing expression of T cell exhaustion markers, such as PD-1. IL-6 treatment of monocytes in vitro upregulated many of the severity-associated genes in the EN-RAGE gene program, along with potential mediators of T cell suppression, such as IL-10. Blockade of IL-6 signaling by tocilizumab in a placebo-controlled clinical trial led to a rapid normalization of ENRAGE and T cell gene expression. This identifies IL-6 as a key driver of myeloid dysregulation associated with worse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients and provides insights into shared pathophysiological mechanisms in non-COVID-19 ARDS.",

      "rel_abs": "Understanding early innate immune responses to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is crucial to developing targeted therapies to mitigate disease severity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infection elicits interferon expression leading to transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to control viral replication and spread. SARS-CoV-2 infection also elicits NF-{kappa}B signaling which regulates inflammatory cytokine expression contributing to viral control and likely disease severity. Few studies have simultaneously characterized these two components of innate immunity to COVID-19. We designed a study to characterize the expression of interferon alpha-2 (IFNA2) and interferon beta-1 (IFNB1), both type-1 interferons (IFN-1), interferon-gamma (IFNG), a type-2 interferon (IFN-2), ISGs, and NF-{kappa}B response genes in the upper respiratory tract (URT) of patients with mild (outpatient) versus severe (hospitalized) COVID-19. Further, we characterized the weekly dynamics of these responses in the upper and lower respiratory tracts (LRTs) and blood of severe patients to evaluate for compartmental differences. We observed significantly increased ISG and NF-{kappa}B responses in the URT of mild compared with severe patients early during illness. This pattern was associated with increased IFNA2 and IFNG expression in the URT of mild patients, a trend toward increased IFNB1-expression and significantly increased STING/IRF3/cGAS expression in the URT of severe patients. Our by-week across-compartment analysis in severe patients revealed significantly higher ISG responses in the blood compared with the URT and LRT of these patients during the first week of illness, despite significantly lower expression of IFNA2, IFNB1, and IFNG in blood. NF-{kappa}B responses, however, were significantly elevated in the LRT compared with the URT and blood of severe patients during peak illness (week 2). Our data support that severe COVID-19 is associated with impaired interferon signaling in the URT during early illness and robust pro-inflammatory responses in the LRT during peak illness.",

      "rel_abs": "The modern response to pandemics, critical for effective public health measures, is shaped by the availability and integration of diverse epidemiological outbreak data. Genomic surveillance has come to the forefront during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at both local and global scales to identify variants of concern. Tracking variants of concern (VOC) is integral to understanding the evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in space and time. Combining phylogenetics with epidemiological data like case incidence, spatial spread, and transmission dynamics generates actionable information. Here we discuss the genome surveillance done in Pune, India, through sequencing 10,496 samples from infected individuals and integrating them with multiple heterogeneous outbreak data. The rise and fall of VOCs along with shifting transmission dynamics in the time interval of December 2020 to March 2022 was identified. Population-based estimates of the proportion of circulating variants indicated the second and third peak of infection in Pune to be driven by VOCs Kappa (B.1.617.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), and Omicron (B.1.1.529) respectively. Integrating single nucleotide polymorphism changes across all sequenced genomes identified C (Cytosine) > T (Thymine) and G (Guanine) > T (Thymine) substitutions to dominate with higher rates of adaptive evolution in Spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and Nucleocapsid (N) genes. Spike Protein mutational profiling during and pre-Omicron VOCs indicated differential rank ordering of high-frequency mutations in specific domains that increased the charge and binding properties of the protein. Time-resolved phylogenetic analysis of Omicron sub-lineages identified specific recombinant X lineages, XZ, XQ, and XM. BA.1 from Pune was found to be highly divergent by global sequence alignment and hierarchical clustering. Our \"band of five\" outbreak data analytics that includes the integration of five heterogeneous data types indicates that a strong surveillance system with comprehensive high-quality metadata was critical to understand the spatiotemporal evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in Pune. We anticipate the use of such integrated workflows to be critical for pandemic preparedness in the future.",

Using data from the first year of the pandemic, we investigated whether an individuals COVID-19 test result was associated with behavioural markers derived from routinely collected hospital data two weeks prior to a test. The temporal and spatial context of behaviours were important, with the highest risks of infection during the first wave, for staff in contact with a greater number of patients and those with greater levels of activity on floors handling the majority of COVID-19 patients. Infection risks were higher for BAME staff and individuals working more shifts. Night shifts presented higher risks of infection between waves of COVID-19 patients. Our results demonstrate the epidemiological relevance of deriving markers of staff behaviour from electronic records, which extend beyond COVID-19 with applications for other communicable diseases and in supporting pandemic preparedness.",

      "rel_abs": "PurposeLong-term humoral immunity to COVID-19 is not well understood owing to the continuous emergence of new variants of concern, the evolving vaccine- and infection-induced immunity, and the limited follow-up of previous studies. As the blood service in Quebec (Canada), we established in April 2021 a COVID-19-focused biobank.\n\nParticipantsAs of January 2022, included 86,229 plasma samples from 15,502 regular donors (age range=18-84 years, female %=49.7%), for an average of 5.6 donations per donor. Nearly two thirds (65.6%) of biobank donors made at least 2 donations, with many donors having provided samples pre- and post-vaccination (3061 [19.75%]) or pre- and post-infection (131 [0.85%]), thus allowing longitudinal studies on vaccine- and infection-induced immunity.\n\nFindings to dateComparative analysis of the immune response after the first and second dose of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine among SARS-CoV-2 naive and previously infected individuals revealed that a single vaccine dose administered to previously infected individuals yields a maximal immune response. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals required two vaccine doses to produce a maximal immune response. Furthermore, the results of a four-phase seroprevalence study indicate that the anti-N antibody response wanes quite rapidly, so that up to one third of previously infected donors were seronegative for anti-N.\n\nFuture plansThis plasma biobank from frequent and motivated donors, and the longitudinal nature of the biobank, will provide valuable insights into the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response and its persistence in time, and the effect of vaccination and of viral variants on the specificity of the antiSARS-CoV-2 immune response.\n\nStrengths and LimitationsThe herein described biobank has several strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this would be the largest biobank of plasma samples dedicated to COVID-19 research, with >80,000 samples from >15,000 donors and new samples continually being added until at least December 2022. Furthermore, the large subset of donors with [&ge;]2 samples (65.6%) - along with the high frequency of donations in this subset (i.e., median: once every 29.0 days) - enables the conduct of longitudinal analyses on COVID-19 immunity. Another strength is that donors provided a broad consent, which allows researchers to recontact them for other projects (e.g., supplemental questionnaire). Lastly, the cost of establishing the biobank was minimized since the infrastructure and personnel required for sample collection were already in place at our blood collection sites. Given these strengths, our biobank may serve as a model for other blood operators and government partners who would be interested in reproducing our initiative elsewhere.\n\nCertain limitations should nonetheless be considered when using our biobank samples. First, only plasma samples are available, such that the biobank cannot be used to study cell-based immunity. Researchers interested in studying cell-based immunity may want to contact BCQ19, which routinely collects peripheral blood mononuclear cells.[1] Second, despite the large sample, the plasma donor population is not fully representative of the overall Quebec population, as expected since plasma donors are typically more representative of the healthy adult population. All exclusion criteria for plasma donations were also exclusion criteria for the biobank including immunodeficiencies, active infection, recent cancer among other chronic diseases. Third, the database associated with our biobank does not include information on disease severity, such as hospitalization or intensive care unit admission. Fourth, the database does not include information on socioeconomic status, such as income and education. However, the six-digit zip code can be used to generate a proxy index for socioeconomic status.",

Understanding factors associated with vaccination uptake can help in planning effective immunization programs. We considered 2,890 health, socioeconomic, familial, and demographic factors measured on the entire Finnish population aged 30 to 80 (N=3,192,505) and genome-wide information for a subset of 273,765 individuals. Risk factors were further classified into 12 thematic categories and a machine learning model was trained for each category. The main outcome was uptaking the first COVID-19 vaccination dose by 31.10.2021, which has occurred for 90.3% of the individuals.\n\nThe strongest predictor category was labor income in 2019 (AUC evaluated in a separate test set = 0.710, 95% CI: 0.708-0.712), while drug purchase history, including 376 drug classes, achieved a similar prediction performance (AUC = 0.706, 95% CI: 0.704-0.708). Higher relative risks of being unvaccinated were observed for some mental health diagnoses (e.g. dissocial personality disorder, OR=1.26, 95% CI : 1.24-1.27) and when considering vaccination status of first-degree relatives (OR=1.31, 95% CI:1.31-1.32 for unvaccinated mothers)\n\nWe derived a prediction model for vaccination uptake by combining all the predictors and achieved good discrimination (AUC = 0.801, 95% CI: 0.799-0.803). The 1% of individuals with the highest risk of not vaccinating according to the model predictions had an average observed vaccination rate of only 18.8%.\n\nWe identified 8 genetic loci associated with vaccination uptake and derived a polygenic score, which was a weak predictor of vaccination status in an independent subset (AUC=0.612, 95% CI: 0.601-0.623). Genetic effects were replicated in an additional 145,615 individuals from Estonia (genetic correlation=0.80, 95% CI: 0.66-0.95) and, similarly to data from Finland, correlated with mental health and propensity to participate in scientific studies. Individuals at higher genetic risk for severe COVID-19 were less likely to get vaccinated (OR=1.03, 95% CI: 1.02-1.05).\n\nOur results, while highlighting the importance of harmonized nationwide information, not limited to health, suggest that individuals at higher risk of suffering the worst consequences of COVID-19 are also those less likely to uptake COVID-19 vaccination. The results can support evidence-informed actions for COVID-19 and other areas of national immunization programs.",

      "rel_abs": "Many secreted proteins contain multiple disulfide bonds. How disulfide formation is coupled to protein folding in the cell remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we combine experiment and simulation to address this question as it pertains to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). We show that, whereas RBD can refold reversibly when its disulfides are intact, their disruption causes misfolding into a nonnative molten-globule state that is highly prone to aggregation and disulfide scrambling. Thus, non-equilibrium mechanisms are needed to ensure disulfides form prior to folding in vivo. Our simulations suggest that co-translational folding may accomplish this, as native disulfide pairs are predicted to form with high probability at intermediate lengths, ultimately committing the RBD to its metastable native state and circumventing nonnative intermediates. This detailed molecular picture of the RBD folding landscape may shed light on SARS-CoV-2 pathology and molecular constraints governing SARS-CoV-2 evolution.",

      "rel_abs": "BackgroundStudies on long COVID differ in the selection of symptoms used to define the condition. We aimed to assess to what extent symptom selection impacts prevalence estimates of long COVID.\n\nMethodsIn a prospective cohort of patients who experienced mild to critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we used longitudinal data on the presence of 20 different symptoms to evaluate changes in the prevalence of long COVID over time when altering symptom selection.\n\nResultsChanging symptom selection resulted in wide variation in long COVID prevalence, even within the same study population. Long COVID prevalence at 12 months since illness onset ranged from 39.6% (95%CI=33.4-46.2) when using a limited selection of symptoms to 80.6% (95%CI=74.8-85.4) when considering any reported symptom to be relevant.\n\nConclusionsComparing the occurrence of long COVID is already complex due to heterogeneity in study design and population. Disparate symptom selection may further hamper comparison of long COVID estimates between populations. Harmonised data collection tools could be one means to achieve greater reproducibility and comparability of results.",

Despite the availability of vaccines, infection rates remain high due to immune evasive Omicron sublineages. Broad-spectrum antivirals are needed to safeguard against emerging variants and future pandemics. We used mRNA display under a reprogrammed genetic code to find a spike-targeting macrocyclic peptide that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain infection and also pseudoviruses containing spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants or related sarbecoviruses. Structural and bioinformatic analyses reveal a conserved binding pocket between the receptor binding domain and other domains, distal to the ACE2 receptor-interaction site. Collectively, our data reveal a hitherto unexplored site of vulnerability in sarbecoviruses that can be targeted by peptides and potentially other drug-like molecules.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryWe identify a conserved site on the SARS-CoV-2 spike that can be targeted by a broadly neutralizing macrocyclic peptide.",

Because it is known that the lungs recover after quitting smoking, a direct comparison of the severity of COVID-19 infection in current and former smokers needs to be investigated.\n\nMethods and analysisThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol (PRISMA-P) 2015 Checklist was used. Non-randomized studies will be searched in PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL library, Embase, and Epistemonikos from December 2019 to the present. Hand-searching of grey literature, key journals, and reference lists will be conducted\n\nThis review will include studies of current and former smokers, with the main outcome being ICU admission, assisted respiration, or death. Two independent reviewers will select primary studies and abstract data from them. The Newcastle-Ottawa checklist will be used to assess the risk of bias, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework will be used to assess the quality of cumulative evidence. RevMan 5.4 will be used for data analysis.\n\nThe I2 statistic will be used to evaluate heterogeneity. For similar studies, the fixed-effect method of a meta-analysis will be used; otherwise, a random-effect model will be used. The qualitative synthesis will be used for studies that are ineligible for the quantitative approach.\n\nEthical consideration and disseminationBecause published data will be reviewed, no ethical approval is required. Our findings will be presented at national and/or international conferences, and they will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nPROSPERO registration number CRD42022368552\n\nARTICLE SUMMARY\n\nStrengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis is a focused research question comparing the current and ex-smokers risk of contracting the severe form of COVID-19.\nC_LIO_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis will provide evidence of the dangers of smoking during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nC_LIO_LIThe PRISMA-P reporting guidelines were strictly followed while writing this protocol.\nC_LIO_LIStudy selection will be carried out by two independent reviewers and a third person will intervene if a disagreement arises.\nC_LIO_LIA potential limitation is that an observational study design will be used in this systematic review.\nC_LI",

      "rel_abs": "People living with HIV (PLWH) on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) can have residual immune dysfunction and often display poorer responses to vaccination. We assessed in a cohort of PLWH (n=110) and HIV negative controls (n=64) the humoral and spike-specific B-cell responses following 1, 2 or 3 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses. PLWH had significantly lower neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers than HIV-negative controls at all studied timepoints. Moreover, their neutralization breadth was reduced with fewer individuals developing a neutralizing response against the Omicron variant (BA.1) relative to controls. We also observed a delayed development of neutralization in PLWH that was underpinned by a reduced frequency of spike-specific memory B cells (MBCs) and pronounced B cell dysfunction. Improved neutralization breadth was seen after the third vaccine dose in PLWH but lower nAb responses persisted and were associated with global, but not spike-specific, MBC dysfunction. In contrast to the inferior antibody responses, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induced robust T cell responses that cross-recognized variants in PLWH. Strikingly, a subset of PLWH with low or absent neutralization had detectable functional T cell responses. These individuals had reduced numbers of circulating T follicular helper cells and an enriched population of CXCR3+CD127+CD8+ T cells after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, which may compensate for sub-optimal serological responses in the event of infection. Therefore, normalisation of B cell homeostasis could improve serological responses to vaccines in PLWH and evaluating T cell immunity could provide a more comprehensive immune status profile in these individuals and others with B cell imbalances.",

      "rel_abs": "Emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 still threaten the effectiveness of currently deployed vaccines, and antivirals can prove to be an effective therapeutic option for attenuating it. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive target due to its sequence conservation and critical role in the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. PLpro also plays very important role in modulation of host immune responses by deubiquitinating (DUBs) or deISGylating host proteins. Thus, targeting PLpro serves as a two-pronged approach to abate SARS-CoV-2. Due to its structural and functional similarities with the host DUB enzymes, an in-house library of DUB inhibitors was constituted in this study. Five promising compounds exhibiting high binding affinities with the substrate binding site of PLpro were identified from a library of 81 compounds with in silico screening, docking, and simulation studies. Interestingly, lithocholic acid, linagliptin, teneligliptin, and flupenthixol significantly inhibited the proteolytic activity of PLpro. Each of these compounds abrogated in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 values in the range of 5-21 M. In addition, crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and its complex with inhibitors have been determined that revealed their inhibitory mechanism. The findings of this study provide the proof-of-principle that the DUB inhibitors hold high potential as a new class of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, this is the first study that has opened a new avenue towards not only targeting PLpro active site but also simultaneously directing towards restoration of antiviral immune response of the host for deterring SARS-CoV-2.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/516107v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea94b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c914c7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7341d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7b48b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

      "rel_abs": "BackgroundDue to high heterogeneity and risk of bias (RoB) in previously published meta-analysis, a concrete conclusion on the efficacy of baricitinib in reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients was unable to form.\n\nMethodsSearch engines PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect and other sources like preprints and reference lists were searched with appropriate keywords. The included evidence was graded with GRADEpro. The RoB, heterogeneity and meta-analysis were studied through RevMan 5.4.1 software. The heterogeneity was evaluated based on the generated p-value or I{superscript 2} test.\n\nResultsEight (8) RCTs were included in current analysis. Five studies had low RoB. Based on grading the evidence, the inclusion and exclusion of high RoB articles led to moderate and high certainty of evidence, respectively. Based on 8 RCTs (with high RoB), baricitinib statistically significantly reduced mortality where the risk ratio (RR) = 0.84 [95% CI: 0.76 to 0.92; p = 0.0002; I2 = 23%; p = 0.25]. The heterogeneity was insignificant but the RoB was high. We did subgroup analysis of low and high RoB articles and found out baricitinib statistically significantly reduced mortality with the RR = 0.68 [95% CI: 0.56 to 0.82; p < 0.0001; I2 = 0%; p = 0.85] and RR = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.80 to 0.99; p = 0.04; I2 = 0%; p = 0.43], respectively. The heterogeneity was 0% with insignificant p-values in both subgroup analyses. The percentage of mortality reduction was 31.31% and 7.79%, respectively whereas it was 13.95% in main group analysis.\n\nConclusionWith the presence of optimal sample size of 3944 from 5 low RoB studies which represents a minimum of 300 million population of people and with 0% of heterogeneity, the effectiveness of baricitinib in reducing the mortality in COVID-19 patients is concretely proven.",

Online conversations provide useful information for assessing sentimental and emotional reactions to the evolutions of the pandemic and immunization program. In this study, we employ a corpus of around 58 million English tweets from users in 17 countries that discuss vaccine-related topics in the year 2021. We apply Soft Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and Time Lag Cross-Correlation approach and find that the evolutions of sentiments closely mirror the pandemic statistics. We also examine five topics connected to vaccination and discover that trust is the most predominate feeling, followed by fear, anger, and joy. Some countries reported higher emotional scores on a theme than others (people in Cuba and the United States exhibit higher levels of trust, Pakistanis and Indians express higher levels of joy, Australians and Chinese express higher levels of fear, and Japanese and British people express higher levels of anger). This study report offers a viewpoint on the publics response to the epidemic and vaccination and aids policy-makers with preventive strategies for a future crisis.",

      "rel_abs": "ObjectiveTo compare the reactogenicity and immunogenicity between the two-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine regimen and one or two doses of inactivated vaccine followed by an mRNA vaccine regimen in healthy children between 5-11 years of age.\n\nMethodsA prospective cohort study was performed at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in Thailand between March to June 2022. Healthy children between 5-11 years of age were enrolled and received the two-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) regimen or the inactivated (CoronaVac) vaccine followed by the BNT162b2 vaccine regimen. In addition, healthy children who received two doses of BBIBP-CorV between 1-3 months prior were enrolled to receive a heterologous BNT162b2 as a third dose (booster).\n\nReactogenicity was assessed by a self-reported online questionnaire. Immunogenicity analysis was performed to determine binding and surrogate neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and Omicron variants.\n\nResultsOverall, 166 eligible children were enrolled. Local and systemic AE which occurred within 7 days after vaccination were mild to moderate and well-tolerated. At one-month, post-two or post-three doses, children vaccinated with two-dose BNT162b2, CoronaVac/BNT162b2, and two-dose BBIBP-CorV followed by BNT162b2 elicited similar levels of anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG. However, the two-dose BNT162b2 and two-dose BBIBP-CorV followed by BNT162b2 groups elicited higher neutralizing activities against Omicron BA.2 variant than the CoronaVac/BNT162b2 group.\n\nConclusionThe heterologous, CoronaVac vaccine followed by the BNT162b2 vaccine, regimen elicited lower neutralizing activities against the emerging Omicron BA.2 variant than the two-dose mRNA regimen. A third dose (booster) mRNA vaccine should be prioritized for this group.",
